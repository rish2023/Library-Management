# Library Management System

This Python program is a simple library management system that allows users to add, delete, list, and search for books in a library. The program stores the library data in a CSV file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this program, you need Python and the pandas library. If you don't have pandas installed, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas


Usage
Clone the repository or download the source code to your local machine.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the code is located.

Run the program by executing the following command:
python library_management.py

Features
Add a Book (Enter 'a'): Add a new book to the library. You will be prompted to enter the book's name, author, price, publisher, and edition.

Delete a Book (Enter 'd'): Delete a book from the library. You will need to provide the name of the book to be deleted.

List Books (Enter 'l'): Display a list of all books in the library.

Search for a Book (Enter 's'): Search for a book by name. If found, the details of the book will be displayed.

Exit (Enter 'q'): Exit the program.

CSV Data Storage
The program uses a CSV file (books.csv) to store library data. This file is located in the same directory as the Python script. When you add or delete books, the changes are reflected in this file.
